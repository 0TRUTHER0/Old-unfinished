        <h1>Computer...</h1>
        <small>i'll explain points very briefly, however i'll provide you with resources to dive deeper</small>
        <p>First,</p>
        <p>if i'd explain a computer to 5 years old kid how will it be like?</p>
        <p>Imagine a computer is like a super smart toy. It has a brain called the CPU that thinks and makes decisions really fast. It has a memory, like you do, called RAM, where it keeps things it's working on right now. There's also a hdd or SSD (ROM) where it stores all the stuff it wants to remember for later, like your games, photos, and music. The screen is like its face, showing you what it's thinking or doing. The keyboard and mouse are like its hands, helping you tell it what to do.

          Now, the operating system is like the computer's superhero costume. It makes everything work together smoothly and helps you talk to the computer easily. With the operating system, your computer knows how to run your games, open your pictures, and even surf the internet. It's what makes your computer friendly and fun to use!<br>there's more! but these are the basic and important components to run a computer.
        </p>

          </ul>
        <p>after watching these 2 videos you might got a little bit confused? what is hardware?<br><br>okay so basicaly a computer is divided into 2 parts [hardware] and [software].</p>
        <center><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zlT-Lg_QFTA/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""></center>
        <p>So as you see, the hardware is anything physical, like the parts you can touch: the CPU, RAM, hard drive, screen, keyboard, and mouse. The software is what you see on your screen and interact with, like the operating system [OS], your browser, games, and other programs. The hardware is the body, and the software is the mind!</p>
        <p>most of you folks, if not all are using either windows or mac and that is called an operating system</p>
        <p>This all you should know, however there somethings i want you to do that will save you a hellamount of time in the future. if you're just like any other normies using the mouse only don't even know how to copy paste text using a keyboard then i highly recommend you to watch the 1st video + 2,3 are obligatory to watch</p>
