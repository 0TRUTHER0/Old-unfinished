<h2>Who am i?</h2>
<p>A self-taught man, i was once a web-developer, linux nerd. but i quitted.</p>
<p>I had this massive curiosity gap in my mind. I was super passionate about learning everything about how computers work, from the tiniest binary stuff (0s and 1s) to building my own custom operating system. My whole learning curve was all about the software side; I didn’t give a crap about hardware like making my own CPU, RAM, disk, and BIOS. If I cared about that, I would've done it—nothing could've stopped me.</p>
<p>So, how long did it take me to learn all this? eight months, man. I was a total nerd, missed the sun like crazy, just learning 24/7 and never getting bored.</p>
<p>i'm arabic, why don't i use my own language? sorry mate arabic isn't allowed in the tech industry like if you have the same interest as me and you're learning in arabic then imma tell ya you're just losing your time. yo arabic learners, i dare you to explain to me why are there so many linux distros out there and what is a distro in itself? what makes the actual different between distros? (e.g debian =/= archlinux =/= red-hat enterprise and so on). Arabic content in the internet is focking BS.</p>
<p>For real,</p>
<p>One thing to mention, linux users are focking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/ufe0n0/when_you_take_unixporn_in_runixporn_seriously/">depressing</a> people. thank god i didn't went down the rabbit hole of the linux community. God protected me! i didn't trun into a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixsocks/">femboy</a> XDDDDDDDD.</p>
<p>You can't contact me, 'cause I won't reply anyway.</p>
<p>So yeah, I filled my learning gap, and I'm out.</p>
