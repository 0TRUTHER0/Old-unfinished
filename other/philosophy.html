                <p>This site follows a minimalist philosophy. Meaning this site doesn't use any bloated frontend
                    languages and just sticks to mainly html & css only. I also stay away from javascript (using no
                    javascript at all on this site) as I'd like to keep my website functional by default for people that
                    use javascript blockers for privacy reasons or people that are using tor. I
                    like to keep it simple (it saves a lot of headache and pages load fast!).</p>
                <p><strong>Anyway...</strong> That is why my page looks like an old-school shit. <pred>Cool?</pred>

                <p>My fellows, ever wondered about how computers truly work?? this is the reason it exists! and of course it's also
                    a way to have an actual presence online.</p>
                <p>To talk about owning a website, you should do it too if you don't have one yet. Even if you don't
                    have any functional programming experience it's <em>
                        <pred>worth it.</pred>
