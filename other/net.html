        <h1>Let's talk about the darknet!</h1>
        <p>there are 3 distinct parts of the internet...</p>
        <ul>
          <li><h2>Surface net (clearnet):</h2></li>
          <p>This is the surface web, it makes around 10% of the internet it is accessible via standard search engines like Google, bing ...etc . Websites on the clearnet have publicly indexed content.</p>
          <p>In other words, when you open the Google search engine at google.com and type "rumble," websites related to the word "rumble" appear in the search results. This is called the surface net (or normies net).</p>
          <li><h2>Deepnet:</h2></li>
          <p>This includes all online content not indexed by search engines. It consists of private databases, academic resources, personal accounts, and other data that require special permissions to access but is not inherently illegal or malicious. and it makes around 88% of the internet. and as an example the website you're currently on is a deepweb site that is not indexed by search engines. (in other words... you need someone to send you a link to access it)</p>
          <li><h2>Darknet: there are 2 different networks</h2></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Tor network (.onion sites)</li>
            <li>i2p network (.i2p sites)</li>
            <p>these make 1-2% of the whole internet</p>
          </ul>
          </ul>
        <center><h1>How do you access the darknet?</h1></center>
        <small>i'll discuss tor .onion websites only, i2p isn't my concern</small>
        <p><strong>so, how do you get in the darknet? obviously by installing tor browser but that isn't enough mate :)</strong></p>
        <p>Wait, First let's talk about the mistakes normies make</p>
        <img src="/media/gjirlfriend.gif" alt="" height="200" width="200">
        <p>- they go to youtube search "darknet", click on random videos in the internet about accessing the darknet. they install tor browser then they connect to TOR network, immidiately after that THEY TELL YOU TO FOCKING USE VPN !!!! and GUESS WHAT!! a FOCKING <strong style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">FREE VPN</strong></p>
        <img src="/media/200.webp" alt="">
        <p>- imagine you want to be completely anonymous for your own reasons, and you went into 3 protection layers you brought a burner phone, costume to be invisible, you did all that shit to be anonymous even your ISP doesn't know what you're doing. and then you have a focking obsessive-compulsive disorder BUTTT you picked a guy from streets, some random guy said he's a <mark>NICE</mark> person. you picked him out for free and took him to do that shit with you. that person is watching you, and you think he's gonna keep his mouth shut? why are you even using tor   if you're gonna expose yourself so fucking easily.</p>
        <p>there's NOTHING FREE in this life. if you ever face something free QUESTION IT!!</p>
        <p>this is the official tor project team answer:</p>
        <img src="/media/tor.png" alt="">
        <p>you can read the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorPlusVPN">wiki</a> page to.</p>
        <p>- A <a href="https://youtu.be/y8bIt4K_Kfo?si=Kk2EbUASVQY5xkXC">Video</a> by mental outlaw.</p>
        <p>those suckers are getting money selling your data to advertise to you.</p>
        <p>Okay then, since i also have obsessive-compulsive disorder. i'll give you the most secure and anonymous way to setup and connect to the tor network in the whole universe. let's get started.</p>
        <h3>So what are we gonna do?</h3>
        <p>We're gonna install an Operating System called <a href="https://tails.net">Tails</a> which is a portable secure operating system that runs completely on the tor network</p>
        <p>But, here's the trick. tails isn't normal! once you boot up to tails it runs on RAM only, so when you turn off your PC everything is gonna be wiped out leaving no trace in your drive. thus, everytime you bootup your system it is gonna be a new fresh and clean OS :)</p>
        <p>thus, when you're doing some illegal shit in your device and the cops come by. just plug out your usb flashdrive and you're clean XD</p>
        <p>+ tails comes with a bunch of pre installed secure <a href="https://tails.net/doc/about/features/index.en.html">tools</a>to enhance your anonymity.</p>
        <img src="/media/andrew-tate-tate.gif" alt="" height="200" width="200">
        <h2>The golden moment has come</h2>
        <p>- First, you're gonna need at least an 8G 3.1-3.2 usb flashdrive</p>
        <small>(don't get tricked by those MFs who sell a 32G for 2.5$. i bought mine 32G 3.1 for 10$ it transfers around 100mb-300mb per second so it's much faster). this usb is gonna be your golden key to the darkweb. so buy one and don't steal your moms usb cause your mom uses it for simple shit and you're gonna use it to burn an os in it</small>
        <p>- Second, i want you to go read <a href="https://tails.net/about/index.en.html">How tails work</a>.</p>
        <p>- Third, Go to <a href="https://tails.net">tails.net</a> then [install tails] -> Windows -></p>
        <img src="/media/tails.png" alt="">
        <p>scroll down -> read everything and follow the steps along until you succeed setting up your os</p>
        <img src="/media/tails2.png" alt="">
        <p>- Fourth, you should've been running your os already. Go read the documentation sect1-general-information, sect3-First-steps-with-tails, sect5-uncensored-and-anonymous-internet, you could read more but i think this is enough as a beginning. you can comeback and read the documentation later on.</p>
        <p>- Now, i want you to go read the <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/about/">tor project documentation</a>(all of it)</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <hr>
        <p>So after you're all setup you can just run tor browser and go, and i won't give you any more info. however here's your first darkweb website to start with: </p>
        <pre style="color: yellow;">http://tortaxi2dev6xjwbaydqzla77rrnth7yn2oqzjfmiuwn5h6vsk2a4syd.onion/</pre>
        <hr>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>And this is how i showed you my dark side and gave you my experience and months of research in one single page... still this page could be updated when i'll have the will to update</p>
