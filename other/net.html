        <h1>Let's talk about the darknet!</h1>
        <p>there are 3 distinct parts of the internet...</p>
        <ul>
          <li><h2>Surface net (clearnet): requires any browser</h2></li>
          <p>This is the surface web, it makes around 10% of the internet it is accessible via standard search engines like Google, bing ...etc . Websites on the clearnet have publicly indexed content.</p>
          <p>In other words, when you open the Google search engine at google.com and type "rumble," websites related to the word "rumble" appear in the search results. This is called the surface net (or normies net).</p>
          <li><h2>Deepnet: requires any browser</h2></li>
          <p>This includes all online content not indexed by search engines. It consists of private databases, academic resources, personal accounts, and other data that require special permissions to access but is not inherently illegal or malicious. and it makes around 88% of the internet. and as an example the website you're currently on is a deepweb site that is not indexed by search engines. (in other words... you need someone to send you a link to access it)</p>
          <li><h2>Darknet: there 2 different networks</h2></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Tor .onion sites which requires <a href="https://torproject.org">tor browser</a> to access it</li>
            <li>i2p .i2p darknet sites </li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
